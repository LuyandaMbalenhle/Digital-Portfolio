### ðŸªž Reflection: Career Counselling (STAR Technique)

**S â€“ Situation**  
As part of my work readiness training, I was required to complete a Career Development quiz that assessed my understanding of topics such as goal setting, career planning, and identifying hard and soft skills.

**T â€“ Task**  
My objective was to test my knowledge and application of the career counselling material and demonstrate my readiness to make informed career decisions.

**A â€“ Action**  
I completed the quiz independently and carefully considered each question, applying concepts I had learned through the career counselling process.

**R â€“ Result**  
I achieved a **100/100 score**, which reflects my strong grasp of the subject matter and my active engagement with the career development process.
